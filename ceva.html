	<h2 style="font-size: 3em;">Discord</h2>
    <br>
	<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #1: Observe the existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows for a given use case – for example, delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours – and propose better approaches (if any). </h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
		<li>
			<h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Existing affordances: </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <h3>Voice and video chat: Discord allows users to engage in high-quality voice and video chats with friends, colleagues, or members of their community.</h3>
                <h3>Text chat: Users can also send text messages to individuals or groups, making it easy to keep in touch with others.</h3>
                <h3>File sharing: Discord provides a platform for sharing files, images, videos, and other media with others.</h3>
                <h3>Screen sharing: Discord allows users to share their screen with others during a voice or video chat, which is helpful for collaboration and remote work.</h3>
                <h3>Server creation and management: Users can create their own servers and customize them to suit their needs. They can also manage their servers by setting roles, permissions, and channels.</h3>
                <h3>Bots: Discord supports a wide range of bots that can be used to automate tasks, manage servers, and enhance the user experience.</h3>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Visual variables: </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <h3>Color: Discord uses a variety of colors to differentiate different channels, users, roles, and statuses. For example, channels are colored based on their category and users have different colors based on their roles. Discord's logo also uses a distinct combination of blue, white, and purple.</h3>
                <h3>Shape: Discord's user interface includes various shapes, such as rectangular text boxes, circular avatars, and square buttons. Each shape serves a specific purpose, such as the rounded edges of the text boxes helping to visually separate messages in a chat.
                </h3>
                <h3>Size: Discord utilizes size to indicate the relative importance of different elements. For example, larger fonts are used for headings and channel names, while smaller fonts are used for individual messages. Additionally, the size of user avatars and emojis can indicate their level of importance in a chat.</h3>
                <h3>Contrast: Contrast is used throughout Discord to improve readability. For example, the contrast between light text on a dark background or dark text on a light background is used to make text easier to read.</h3>
                <h3>Motion: Discord uses motion to provide feedback and create a sense of interactivity. For example, when a user joins a voice chat, their avatar will move to the chat room to visually indicate their presence.</h3>
                <h3>Texture: Discord uses texture to create the illusion of dimensionality in its design. For example, the background of Discord's user interface includes a subtle pattern that adds visual interest and helps to visually separate different sections of the app. Additionally, emojis and icons have a distinct texture that helps them stand out from other elements.
                </h3>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Interaction flows: </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <h3>Joining and leaving servers: To join a new server, users typically either receive an invitation link from another user or search for public servers in Discord's server directory. Once they have joined a server, users can easily leave by clicking on the server name and selecting "Leave Server".</h3>
                <h3>Navigating channels: Discord's channels allow users to communicate with others in different chat rooms. Users can navigate between channels by clicking on their names in the channel list, or by typing in the channel name in the search bar.</h3>
                <h3>Sending messages: Users can send messages in Discord by typing into the text box at the bottom of a channel. They can also include emojis, GIFs, and attachments to their messages.</h3>
                <h3>Voice and video chat: Discord offers voice and video chat features for users to communicate with others in real-time. Users can join a voice or video chat by clicking on the relevant channel and clicking the "Join Voice" or "Join Video" button.</h3>
                <h3>Managing user settings: Users can customize their Discord experience by adjusting their settings, such as changing their username, profile picture, and notification preferences. These settings can be accessed by clicking on the user icon in the bottom left corner of the screen and selecting "User Settings".</h3>
                <h3>Moderating servers: Server administrators and moderators have additional tools and settings to manage their servers, such as creating roles and permissions, managing bans and warnings, and adjusting channel settings.
                </h3>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #2: Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a text-only interaction (see CLI – Command Line Interface). </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Visual metaphors and idioms: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Icons - used to indicate different actions or functions, (i.e. a microphone icon to indicate that a user is speaking in a voice chat). In a text-only interaction, these icons could be replaced with text labels, such as "Speaking" or "Muted".</h3>
            <h3>Emojis - used to express emotions and reactions to messages. In a text-only interaction, similar concepts could be represented using text-based emoticons, such as ":-)" for a smile or ":-(" for a sad face.</h3>
            <h3>Colors: Discord uses colors to differentiate between different channels and user roles. In a text-only interaction, similar concepts could be conveyed using text formatting, such as bold or italic text to indicate important information.</h3>
            <h3>Hierarchy: Discord uses size and placement to indicate the hierarchy of different elements, such as larger fonts for channel names and smaller fonts for individual messages. In a text-only interaction, similar concepts could be replaced using text formatting or text-colors to indicate different levels of importance.</h3>
            <h3>Motion: Discord uses animation and motion to manifest in a natural way what is happening at the moment, for example the Discord logo rolling while loading, or the caller's profile picture pulsating while calling. In a text-only interaction, similar concepts could be represented using text-based feedback, such as "Loading... / Calling..." to indicate the same functionalities.</h3>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #3: Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts. </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Cognitive overload: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Multiple servers and channels: Discord allows users to join multiple servers and channels, which can sometimes result in information overload. Users may find it difficult to keep track of all the different conversations and topics happening at once, which can be overwhelming.</h3>
            <h3>Notifications: Discord has a notification system that alerts users to new messages, mentions, and other events. While this can be useful, it can also lead to cognitive overload if users receive too many notifications at once.</h3>
            <h3>Bots: Discord supports a wide range of bots that can enhance the platform's functionality. However, users may once again find it difficult to keep track of all the different bots and commands, which can lead to cognitive overload.</h3>
            <h3>Customization options: Discord offers a high degree of customization, allowing users to create their own servers, channels, and roles. While this can be useful, it can also lead to cognitive overload if users are presented with too many options and decisions to make. For example, the User Settings tab comes from the start with 20+ categories of settings to be chosen from, which will trigger certain settings once clicked, and so on.</h3>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #4: List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms – for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile native. Each improvement will be listed in pairs: UI/UX problem identified & solution suggested. </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Improvements: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>When playing a certain game or accessing a specific application, discord will automatically display under your name that you're
                using it,  through  its "rich presence" feature. This feature allows game developers to integrate their game's status and details into Discord, allowing users to share their current game activity with their friends. If the game/application does not have integrated rich presence, you can still manually set your status to show what game you are playing, by clicking on "Settings -> Game Activity". However, while this feature seems to work on desktop, Discord hasn't yet implemented this on mobile level.</h3>
            <h3>In addition to voice and video calls, Discord also has a "Share-screen" feature, allowing users to share their computer screens with others. This feature is particularly useful for gaming or remote work scenarios where users need to collaborate or show their screen to others, and can be easily activated while in a call, by pressing the "Share screen" button. This is, once again, a feature that is available only on desktop, and yet to be developed on mobile platforms too.</h3>
            <h3>Discord also offers a range of voice settings that allow users to customize their audio input and output settings to suit their preferences and devices. These settings can be accessed by clicking on the user settings icon located in the bottom left corner of the app and then clicking on the "Voice & Video" tab. Some of the main voice settings are Input Sensitivity, Voice Activity, Output/Input device and Attenuation. Each of those contribute to a customizable enhanced voice experience on desktop, while missing when we talk about mobile platforms. </h3>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #5: How the empiric laws (Fitts’, Hick’s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction? </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Answer: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Fitt's law it's usually respected in the transition from computer to mobile since more advanced functionalities are harder to see/find in the mobile version, and those expected to be used like calling, texting, sending photos are displayed larger on the screen since while designing the mobile version it we should expect less technical focus from the user and maybe more of a hurried expercience where you need to find things quickly. Therefore the distance to the expected target is already well adjusted.</h3>
            <h3>Hick's law is best portrayed when in the mobile version, when reacting to a message, the there are only 5 emojis and an option to show all of them in contrast with the PC version which shows all of them from the start. This can significantly reduce the time necessary for the choice to be made. However the list of servers could have been adapted better, maybe with a special category/sorting method for the servers with the most unread messages in order to be easier to choose which one to check first.</h3>
            <h3>The Empirical Law of Steering, which refers to the tendency of users to choose the shortest possible path when interacting with a graphical user interface, could be reconsidered in the context of multi-device interaction on Discord.
            </h3>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #6: List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch those new features on paper and/or digitally.  </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Three new features: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>1. One of the main new features we would add is a "chat filtering" option. This would prevent spam messages from flooding a server, moderate content in order to enforce community guidelines, protect users against malicious links and phishing attempts. </h3>
            <h3>2. Another feature is an "edit history", since Discord allows users to edit messages, but not to see the previous edited message. This would ensure non-repudiation, since both participants have to agree on what was previously sent/seen, and none can manipulate the message in order to  create chaos or change context.</h3>
            <h3>3. The last feature regards Discord's text size and fonts, since none of them are available at the moment. Being able to adjust the text size can make the chat more accessible for users who may have visual impairments or difficulty reading smaller text, while allowing them to customize their experience on Discord, therefore making it more enjoyable.</h3>

            <br>
            <ul>
                <h3>Color: The color scheme used in the interface can affect the user's mood and perception. Zoom uses a blue and white color scheme that is calming and professional.</h3>
                <h3>Size: The size of elements on the screen can influence how important they appear. For example, larger buttons and text may seem more important and draw the user's attention.</h3>
                <h3>Shape: The shape of elements can convey meaning and affect user perception. Zoom's rectangular buttons and windows create a structured and organized interface.</h3>
                <h3>Contrast: Contrast between elements can help users distinguish between different components of the interface. Zoom uses high contrast between buttons and background to make them stand out.</h3>
                <h3>Animation: Animations can be used to draw attention and create a sense of interactivity. Zoom uses animations to indicate when someone is speaking or to highlight the active speaker.</h3>
                <h3>Typography: The font type, size, and weight can affect readability. Zoom uses a simple font that is easy to read on different devices.</h3>

                <h3>Joining a meeting: Zoom makes it easy for users to join meetings by providing a simple and clear interface that allows users to enter a meeting ID or use a link to join.</h3>
                <h3>Audio and video controls: it allows users to adjust their microphone and camera settings. This is important as it impacts the user's ability to communicate effectively during a meeting.</h3>
                <h3>Screen sharing: is a key feature of Zoom that allows users to share their screen with others. This is crucial for collaborative work and presentations.</h3>
                <h3>Chatting: Zoom's chat feature allows users to communicate with other participants during a meeting. This is useful for sharing links, files, or other information with other attendees.</h3>
                <h3>Recording: Zoom's recording feature allows users to record meetings for later reference. This can impact user perception by providing a sense of security and accountability.</h3>
                <h3>Leaving a meeting: The final interaction flow is leaving a meeting. Zoom makes it easy for users to leave a meeting by providing a clear and simple interface.</h3>

    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Visual metaphors and idioms: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Gallery view: it displays participants in a grid-like layout, a physical gallery of people. This layout allows users to see multiple participants at once, making it easier to follow group conversations.</h3>
            <h3>Speaker view: Zoom's speaker view highlights the active speaker, focusing on the person speaking in a physical meeting. This layout helps users to stay engaged and follow the conversation more easily.</h3>
            <h3>Raise hand: Zoom's "raise hand" feature is an idiom for signaling a desire to speak in a group conversation. This feature allows users to virtually raise their hand, indicating that they have something to contribute.</h3>
            <h3>Chat bubble: the chat feature uses a chat bubble icon, which is a visual metaphor for speech bubbles in comics or cartoons. This icon helps users to recognize the chat feature and understand its purpose.</h3>
            <h3>Stop video: Zoom's "stop video" feature uses a camera icon with a diagonal line across it, which is an idiom for a camera being turned off. This icon helps users to recognize that their video feed is turned off.</h3>
            <h3>End meeting: Zoom's "end meeting" feature uses an icon of a door, which is an idiom for leaving a physical meeting. This icon helps users to recognize the end of a meeting and to exit the call.</h3>
        </ul>
        <br>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Cognitive overload: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Multiple participants: Zoom can display up to 49 participants in gallery view, which can be overwhelming and make it difficult for users to focus on the conversation.</h3>
            <h3>Multiple modes of communication: Zoom offers multiple modes of communication, including audio, video, chat, and screen sharing. Managing these different modes of communication can be challenging and lead to cognitive overload.</h3>
            <h3>Technical issues: Technical issues such as poor audio or video quality, internet connectivity problems, or software glitches can cause frustration and cognitive overload.</h3>
            <h3>Multi-tasking: Users may be tempted to multitask during Zoom meetings, such as checking emails or completing other work. However, this can lead to cognitive overload and decrease productivity.</h3>
            <h3>Lack of nonverbal cues: Nonverbal cues, such as body language or facial expressions, are important for communication. However, in virtual meetings, these cues may be more difficult to interpret, leading to cognitive overload as users try to compensate for the lack of information.</h3>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #4: List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms – for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile native.

    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Improvements: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Advanced Audio Settings: On the PC platform, Zoom allows users to adjust audio settings such as speaker and microphone volume, and select which audio device to use. However, the phone app has limited audio settings, and users are not able to adjust the audio quality or select different audio devices. Zoom could improve the phone app by adding more advanced audio settings, which would give users more control over their audio experience.</h3>
            <h3>Gallery View: Zoom allows users to see multiple participants on the screen at the same time in Gallery View when on PC platforms, while the phone app only displays one participant at a time, which can make it difficult to follow group conversations. Zoom could improve the phone app by adding a Gallery View option, which would allow users to see more than one participant on the screen at the same time.</h3>
            <h3>Virtual Backgrounds: The last improvement regards virtual backgrounds on the PC app, which can be a fun and creative way to customize the appearance of the meeting. However, the phone app does not support virtual backgrounds, which can be disappointing for users who want to use this feature. Zoom could improve the phone app by adding support for virtual backgrounds, which would allow users to use this feature on their phones as well. </h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Task #5: How the empiric laws (Fitts’, Hick’s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction? </h2>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.7em;">Answer: </h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <h3>Fitt's law is implemented in Zoom with the help of icons that are both big enough to be selected, especially on the mobile version where the accuracy may be lower due to touchscreen issues. 
                There appears to be no feature with a small enough display to cause frustation.</h3>
            <h3>On desktop, upon starting the app you are greeted with only two options: Join a Meeting and Sign In. This is a good choice to make in order to make joining meetings a faster procees according to Hick's empirical law, since this is the action that is usually the most time bound(being late to meetings).
                The more advanced options come upon deciding to sign in, meaning that you probably already took some time to familiarize yourself with the app. 
                On mobile, if you are signed in, the interface is as loaded as in the desktop version, which defies the usual standard to make the mobile app easier to navigate. Considering that "Schedule", 'Share Screen" and "Add a calandar" are not basic interactions they could be moved to another place so further satisfy Hick's law.</h3>
            <h3>On desktop, here are few dropdown menus and those are quite thick and nested only once, therefore not needing too much precision. This implementation seems to fit Steering's law quite well.</h3>

            <h3>2. Automatic transcription feature that transcribes the audio from a Zoom meeting in real-time.</h3>
            <h3>3. Virtual Reality Integration: Zoom could add virtual reality (VR) integration, allowing users to join meetings in a VR environment. This would create a more immersive and interactive experience, and could be especially useful for remote teams that want to collaborate in a virtual space. Users could customize their avatars and interact with each other in a 3D environment, making meetings more engaging and dynamic.</h3>
